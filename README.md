### Introduction  
  
Current baselines in biomedical image segmentation utilise fully-convolutional structures for the benefits of end-to-end trainability, size-invariance and efficiency. One such method is U-Net [1], a two-track contraction-expansion model which fuses features at different hierarchies with the objective of generating deep localisable features. Here, I introduce Corona-Net, a 3-part contribution dedicated to the classification, binary segmentation and multi-class segmentation of COVID-19. I first leverage the EfficientNet model [2] for COVID-19 diagnosis, achieving an accuracy of 94.00%. I then utilise and refine the U-Net architecture for both binary and 3-class (ground-glass, consolidation, pleural effusion) segmentation of COVID-19 symptoms, through inference on the 100-slice COVID-19 CT segmentation (chest axial CT) dataset 1, and 630-slice COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset 2 [3]. Through strong data augmentation and rigorous experimentation, I overcome the small dataset size (630) to achieve a Dice Loss of 79.65% (dataset 2) and 61.60% (dataset 1). Through Corona-Net, I aim to develop a reliable, visual-semantically balanced method for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis confirmation, in order to contribute to the fight against this pandemic.
